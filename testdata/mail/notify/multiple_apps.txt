Hi cloud.gov user,

cloud.gov frequently updates the programming language buildpacks available to
our customers. Buildpack updates include programming language updates and 
often include security fixes.

We recently updated buildpacks in use by your applications. You should 
restage your applications to take advantage of the update. You can do this by
opening the command line and entering the following commands:

  cf target -o sandbox -s dev ; cf restage my-drupal-app

  cf target -o paid-org -s staging ; cf restage my-wordpress-app


For more information on keeping your application updated and secure, see: 
https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/app-maintenance/

If you have questions, you can email us at cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov.

Thank you,
The cloud.gov team
