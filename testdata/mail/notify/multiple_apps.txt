We recently made new security improvements to cloud.gov.

To take advantage of them, please restage your applications immediately [1].

To do so, open the command line and enter the following for each app: "cf restage YOURAPPNAME"

Please run that command for the following applications:

- my-drupal-app (Organization: sandbox, Space: dev)

- my-wordpress-app (Organization: paid-org, Space: staging)

Questions? Consult the documentation [2] or email us at cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov.

Thank you,
The cloud.gov team
