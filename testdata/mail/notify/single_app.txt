Hi cloud.gov user,

cloud.gov frequently updates the programming language buildpacks available to our customers, and we recently updated the buildpack that your application uses. Buildpack updates include programming language updates and often include security fixes.

To take advantage of buildpack updates, you should restage your application. Documentation for this process: https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/app-maintenance/

You can restage apps by opening the command line and entering the following command: cf restage YOURAPPNAME

The following application has an updated buildpack available:

- my-drupal-app (Organization: sandbox, Space: dev)

If you have questions, email us at cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov.

Thank you,
The cloud.gov team
