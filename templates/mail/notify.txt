Hi cloud.gov user,

cloud.gov frequently updates the programming language buildpacks available to our customers, and we recently updated 
{{- if .IsMultipleApp}} the buildpacks that your applications use. {{else}} the buildpack that your application uses. {{end -}}
Buildpack updates include programming language updates and often include security fixes.

To take advantage of buildpack updates, you should restage your application{{if .IsMultipleApp}}s{{end}}.

{{if .IsMultipleApp}}
You can restage your out-of-date apps by opening the command line and entering the following commands:
{{else}}
You can restage your out-of-date app by opening the command line and entering the following command:
{{end -}}

{{range .Apps}}
- cf target -o {{ .SpaceData.Entity.OrgData.Entity.Name }} -s {{ .SpaceData.Entity.Name }} ; cf restage {{.Name}} 
{{end}}

For more information about ensuring your app stays updated and secure, see our documentation:
