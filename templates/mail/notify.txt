Buildpack updates include programming language updates and often include security fixes.

To take advantage of buildpack updates, you should restage your application{{if .AppPlural}}s{{end}}. Documentation for this process: https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/app-maintenance/

You can restage apps by opening the command line and entering the following command: cf restage YOURAPPNAME
