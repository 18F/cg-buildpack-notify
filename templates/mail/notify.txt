We recently made new security improvements to cloud.gov.

To take advantage of them, please restage your {{.AppNoun}} immediately [1].

To do so, open the command line and enter the following for each app: "cf restage YOURAPPNAME"

Please run that command for the following {{.AppNoun}}:
{{range .Apps}}
- {{.Name}} (Organization: {{ .SpaceData.Entity.OrgData.Entity.Name }}, Space: {{ .SpaceData.Entity.Name }})
{{end}}
Questions? Consult the documentation [2] or email us at cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov.

Thank you,
The cloud.gov team
