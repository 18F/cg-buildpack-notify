Hi cloud.gov user,

cloud.gov frequently updates the platform underneath your applications, and we recently updated buildpacks that your applications use. Buildpack updates include programming language updates and often include security fixes.

To take advantage of buildpack updates, you should restage your {{.AppNoun}}. Documentation for this process: https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/app-maintenance/

You can restage apps by opening the command line and entering the following command: cf restage YOURAPPNAME

The following {{.AppNoun}} have updated buildpacks available:
{{range .Apps}}
- {{.Name}} (Organization: {{ .SpaceData.Entity.OrgData.Entity.Name }}, Space: {{ .SpaceData.Entity.Name }})
{{end}}
If you have questions, email us at cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov.

Thank you,
The cloud.gov team
